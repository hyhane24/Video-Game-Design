Main scene is demo. \
\
As far as I know, requirements were all completed and no bugs. \
Nothing extra was implemented in addition to assignment requirements. \
\
No creative implementations, external assets, or non-standard build dependencies. \
\
About changing the Product Name, I did use a resource (https://answers.unity.com/questions/12919/how-to-change-the-file-name-for-the-final-build.html) to figure out how to change the name to Yie_H_m1. \
Felt like I should mention it in case this counts as \'93external\'94 :) \
\
Thank you! \
