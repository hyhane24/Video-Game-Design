Main scene is demo. 

Nothing extra was implemented in addition to assignment requirements. 

About yellow objects chaining, I had trouble with implementing the swinging motions. 
I was able to make ConfigureJoints connected 5 rigid bodies (in the sky in the scene). 

About implementing the beetle movement, I used random generator to set fly velocities for each of x, y, and z. 
I did look up an internet source for random generator syntax, such as Stack Overflow.
No direct codes were used from the internet, simple function syntax was referred.  

Also, since this project was built upon M1 contents, my auditor was based on M1 auditor. 
I had error messages based on the criteria for M1 (for example, I had an error of Yie_H_m2 not matching Yie_H_m1, which should have been correct).
I did read through the submission and packaging requirements and compared my current submission to previous submission to make sure though!

Thank you! :)
