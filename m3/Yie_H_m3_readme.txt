Milestone 3

Main scene is demo and GameMenuScene.

Nothing extra was implemented in addition to assignment requirements. (No extra credit) 

All the required features were implemented using the Milestone guidelines. 

For the last portion of implementation, I used Kitsune masks as placeholders. 
When player collides with one of the 3 prefabs, the Kitsune runs away from the player. 

Our game made by our group is a space war game (player has to fight against aliens to win the game).
Our game is an allusion to Alice in Wonderland (a player goes through various lands while meeting mythical creatures, fights off antagonists, and gains help from objects/characdters). 
My implementation in this milestone was as if Alice met the White Rabbit who gives out hints to get to the destination, yet runs away immediately after answering the question. 
Root motion Random Dude is Alice, and Kitsune mask is the rabbit. 

Thank you! :) 

** I received a feedback that my readme is bit hard to read due to formatting. 
I hope the formatting I used this time helps, but please let me know if it is still hard to read. 
On my end, it seems fine but just to be sure! Thank you again!
