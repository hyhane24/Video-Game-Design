Milestone 4

Main scene is demo. 

Nothing extra was implemented in addition to assignment requirements.

The main build is OSX and Windows is untested. 

All the required features were implemented using the Milestone guidelines. 
I did utilize online source for require/reference component usage (looked up syntax only, no codes). 

I used cyan+purple cubes as stationary and moving waypoints. There are 5 stationary and 1 moving kind. 

For baking, I selected the entire 'tutorialArena_01' to ensure all the grounds are covered.

Thank you! :)
