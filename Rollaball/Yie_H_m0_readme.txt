Main Scene is MiniGame. Main build is OSX (Build/OSX) and Windows (Build/Windows) is the untested version. 

- Name is added to the HUD in bright pink at the top left corner of the screen.
- Hidden meta data modified to be shown.
- Change to the script: When the user reaches ball count 11, the message "Just one more!" is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
  This message is removed when "You win!" is displayed when reaching count == 12. SetActive false/true is used in the script. 
- Change to 3D graphics: the player ball was changed to bright pink instead of light blue, which is instructed in the tutorial.
- Both OSX and Windows version present in the "Build" folder. OSX is the MAIN build and Windows is the UNTESTED version. 

** Note **

There is no bug in the game-play it self but I did confront an issue cleaning up the files.

I am aware that dependent files such as "Library", "Temp" and "Obj" need to be removed for submission.
However, when I removed these files for submission, my Unity project completely crashed.
I am fully aware that this is subject to points deduction, but I really did not know what to do after fighting with them for a couple of hours. 

If TA's could leave a feedback for this issue (if it is normal to crash, yet files still need to be deleted for submission only), I would sincerely appreciate it!
This was my first milestone and I am sure I will get better in cleaning the files from the next submission by referring feedbacks.

Thank you! Any feedback or advice would be appreciated :)
